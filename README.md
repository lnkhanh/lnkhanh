<p>I like programming and I always want to learn new things.</p>

Ever since I was a little kid with little dream, software development has been my passion.
I still remember sitting in front of the computer with old model from public net shop, with the basic WEB course from W3Schools and making it print “Hello world”.
As I went through the basic tutorial, it was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing in these funny little symbols, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity.
Throughout university, I latched on to any ideas for projects I could get, moving from “Hello world” all the way to a lot of applications, with dozens of projects in between, I learned PHP, then Java, tearing through any tutorials I could find on anything remotely related to software development. I was insatiable.

This passion carried me through my education at university. Here there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. The dream came true.
I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, higher mathematics, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid.
And it was here that I leaned truly how much there was yet to learn.

So now, in industry, this passion remains with me. There is certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.

I am an Agile developer.
